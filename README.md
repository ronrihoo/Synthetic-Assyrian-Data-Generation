# Synthetic Assyrian Data Generation

## Overview
This project aims to build a 1 million word synthetic Assyrian dataset using Large Language Models (LLMs). There are approximate hopes for three phases, but plans for only the first one. Phase 1 has five stages planned.

### Stage 1: Generate Sentence Categories
* Utilize various LLMs, including Llama 3.1 8B, to generate a list of 1500+ sentence categories.

### Stage 2: Generate English Sentences
* Feed each category into Llama 3.1 405B to generate at least one English sentence per category.
* Aim for at least 2500 English sentences (reusing any random set of categories for the remainder).
* Each sentence will have the following metadata:
	+ Category
	+ Word parts (listed in the same order and positions as the respective words in the sentence)
	+ Short description conveying meaning/context

### Stage 3: Generate Assyrian Sentences
* Feed each English sentence (along with its metadata) to Claude 3.5 Sonnet to generate its Assyrian equivalent.
* Generate word parts for the Assyrian sentences as well.

### Stage 4: Validate Assyrian Sentences (Human in the Loop)
* Validate all generated Assyrian sentences manually, as some may require editing.

### Stage 5: Generate Variants of Each Sentence
* Use Python scripts to replace words with synonyms and rotate word parts of the same type (e.g., verb-to-verb).
* Aim for an average of 50 variants per sentence or more, depending on the average words per sentence.

## Progress
The concept has been proven by going through the first 4 stages with a dataset of 30 sentences. Stage 5 was considered trivial in the process.

Stage 1: 1650 English sentence categories have been generated using various LLMs (including Llama 3.1 8B). This stage may be considered complete. (1650/1500 complete.)

Stage 2: 1040 English sentences (with metadata) have been generated based on 1024 categories (using Llama 3.1 405B). (1040/2500 complete.)

Stage 3: only 30 Assyrian sentences (with metadata) have been generated (using Claude 3.5 Sonnet), carrying over from concept proof. (30/2500 complete.)

Stage 4: all 30 Assyrian sentences (including their metadata) have been validated and/or revised. (30/2500 complete.)

Stage 5: no activity yet. (0/125000 complete.)

## Questions on Methodology

Why categories? To achieve variety.

Why English to Assyrian? So that we could have an LLM produce the Assyrian data. It's so much faster. (LLMs "understand" English, but not so much Assyrian, yet.)

Why extra metadata? Ensure equivalent Assyrian sentences are generated by providing multiple points of reference for clarity and meaning. Additionally, create high-quality datasets for future applications while we're at it.

## Philosophy
Accuracy is key. This project prioritizes high-quality and accurate data. 

Accuracy doesn't mean real-world representation. Bizarre sentences are still acceptable as long as they're correct in structure/construct.

If someone types something bizarre in a translation app, then they should still be able to get the result they want.

Example of a perfectly good sentence:
"John ate a rock while flying on a fire."

Example of a bad sentence:
"John had a rock eating on a had had life."

## Plans

* Phase 1: Tiny language model with 1+ million Assyrian words.
* Phase 2: Small language model with 10+ million Assyrian words.
* Phase 3: Mediocre language model with 100+ million Assyrian words.
* Ultimate goal: Create a language model capable of Assyrian translation, summarization, and question-answer interactions, which should be achieved by the end of phase 3.
